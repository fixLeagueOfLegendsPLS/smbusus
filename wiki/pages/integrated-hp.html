      <h3 id="understanding-stigma">Understanding and Addressing Stigma</h3>
      <p>Data collection in rural areas revealed that <strong>stigma remains one of the main barriers to diagnosis, treatment, and social integration</strong> for people living with HBV. Even among those with a basic understanding of the virus, community members often avoided discussing the topic, fearing judgment and preferring to conceal their status.</p>
      <p>Our surveys highlighted the intensity of <strong>fear and shame associated with HBV</strong>. Most participants—both patients and their close ones (family members, partners, friends)—refused to be interviewed or agreed to speak only under strict conditions of anonymity. Even short conversations were often marked by discomfort, tension, and emotional detachment.</p>
      <p>To assess the extent of misinformation, we deliberately included incorrect modes of transmission—such as coughing, public toilets, or contact with animals—into the questionnaire. A significant portion of respondents marked these as true, revealing a widespread presence of <strong>myths and misconceptions</strong>. These inaccuracies further contribute to public anxiety, fuel social isolation of infected individuals, and hinder prevention, open discussion, and timely treatment.</p>
      <p>These findings led us to explore scientific literature and large-scale social studies to better understand the <strong>scope and consequences of HBV-related stigma</strong>.</p>
      <p>Research confirms that HBV stigma remains a <strong>serious social and medical issue</strong>. Despite anti-discrimination laws in China, people living with HBV still face <strong>exclusion in employment, education, healthcare, and daily life</strong>.</p>
      <p>Stigma has profound negative effects on quality of life. It undermines physical health, disrupts psychological well-being, limits social ties, and decreases satisfaction with one’s environment (Li et al., 2020). Increased anxiety, depression, lowered self-esteem, and emotional exhaustion are common. In some cases, this leads to <strong>suicidal ideation</strong> (Jin et al., 2020).</p>
      <p>But stigma doesn’t only impact mental health—it <strong>directly disrupts public health systems</strong>. Fear of being judged prevents individuals from seeking medical care. Patients often hide their diagnosis, even from close relatives, and avoid screenings and tests, particularly in rural communities and among youth (Zhang et al., 2019). Studies show that <strong>up to 50% of vulnerable individuals opt out of testing due to fear of being socially marked</strong>.</p>
      <p>Even in educational and professional settings, HBV remains a taboo topic, reinforcing the illusion that the disease is “someone else’s problem.” This misconception promotes hidden transmission and undermines vaccination efforts (Jin et al., 2020).</p>
      <p>Post-diagnosis, many patients fail to follow prescribed treatments—not only out of fear of exposure but also due to <strong>internalized stigma</strong>, leading to guilt and a feeling of being undeserving of care. Research indicates that individuals with high internal stigma are <strong>1.8 times more likely to skip follow-up care</strong> and have distorted perceptions of their health (Wang et al., 2025).</p>
      <p>Stigma directly reduces treatment adherence: patients may stop taking medication, avoid follow-up appointments, or fully disengage from the healthcare system (Li et al., 2020). Those in socially unstable situations or with limited access to resources are especially vulnerable.</p>
      <p>The <strong>psychosocial burden</strong> of HBV demands not only clinical, but also <strong>psychological support</strong>. Depression, anxiety, and social withdrawal impair patients’ ability to engage with their treatment (Jin et al., 2020).</p>
      <p>The social consequences of stigma are deep and long-lasting. Patients experience <strong>limited career and educational opportunities, broken relationships</strong>, and <strong>withdrawal from community life</strong> (Li et al., 2020). Even people not infected with the virus often display avoidant behavior: up to half of surveyed Chinese citizens admitted they would not want to be near someone with HBV.</p>
      <p>Alarmingly, <strong>breaches of medical confidentiality by healthcare professionals</strong> still occur in China, including disclosing a patient’s status to their employer or school. This contributes to <strong>institutionalized stigma</strong>, leaving even well-educated patients feeling exposed and vulnerable (Zhang et al., 2019).</p>
      <p>Patients with lower education levels or those living in rural areas are <strong>particularly at risk</strong> of discrimination and social isolation. This creates a vicious cycle: lack of information and support amplifies fear, which in turn strengthens stigma and obstructs prevention.</p>
      <p>To break this cycle, we launched a <strong>public awareness campaign</strong> aimed at normalizing open conversation about hepatitis B and supporting those affected by stigma. Through personal stories, interviews, and visual materials, we sought to show that <strong>behind every diagnosis is a person</strong>.</p>
      <p>During in-person outreach, we encountered significant resistance—people declined to participate, avoided eye contact, or grew visibly uncomfortable. As a result, we shifted to an <strong>online-first format</strong> to lower the barrier and still gather valuable stories.</p>
      <p>We published invitations and contacted communities focused on viral hepatitis—both in China and in Russian-speaking networks.</p>
      <p><strong>Platforms used included:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Xiaohongshu (RED)</li>
        <li>Douyin (Chinese TikTok)</li>
        <li>Instagram</li>
        <li>Health-related blogs and forums, including N’s chronic illness blog</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In these posts, we invited people to <strong>anonymously or openly share their stories</strong>—whether as healthcare professionals, social workers, patients, or their close ones. We also contacted bloggers and medical influencers to help amplify our call. Some of them even <strong>actively joined the project</strong>—offering interviews or publishing supportive commentary.</p>
      <p>As a result, we conducted interviews with <strong>XXX patients, XXX healthcare professionals</strong>, and several <strong>family members and friends of those affected</strong>. With consent, selected interviews were edited and published as part of our project’s online space: a digital exhibition titled <strong>“Faces of the Disease”</strong>, aimed at <strong>breaking stereotypes and showing the human side of HBV</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>Total viewership across all platforms exceeded XXX</strong>, including:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Xiaohongshu: XXX</li>
          <li>Instagram: XXX</li>
          <li>Douyin: XXX</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We received an <strong>emotional and encouraging response</strong> from individuals living with HBV and their loved ones, many of whom expressed a sense of relief at not feeling alone.</p>
      <p>These personal accounts significantly shaped our project’s development and outreach strategies. Publishing these interviews and organizing online/offline exhibitions allowed us to <strong>not only share real stories, but also provide science-based materials</strong> on HBV transmission, treatment, and patient rights. This multi-pronged approach helped counter misinformation, engage emotionally, and <strong>foster empathy</strong>.</p>
      <p>The “Faces of the Disease” format—visual and accessible—was especially effective in drawing attention to the <strong>social dimension</strong> of the problem. Real faces, real quotes, and real stories resonated widely, especially among young people.</p>
      <p>We also <strong>revised our internal ethical protocols</strong>, offering participants the choice to be anonymous or open, online or offline. We provided interview questions in advance and guaranteed the right to withdraw at any time. These practices helped build trust and ensured the project remained safe and inclusive for everyone involved.</p>
