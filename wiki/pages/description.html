      <h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>
      <p><strong>Hepatitis B</strong> is the most common serious <strong>liver infection</strong> in the world — and yet, one of the most overlooked. According to the World Health Organization, over <strong>254 million people</strong> are living with chronic HBV infection globally. Caused by a small DNA virus that targets the liver, HBV spreads silently and slowly, often showing no symptoms until it has already caused <strong>irreversible liver damage</strong> such as <strong>cirrhosis</strong> or <strong>hepatocellular carcinoma</strong> — one of the deadliest forms of cancer. In 2022 alone, <strong>1.1 million people</strong> died from hepatitis B-related complications.</p>
      <p>Despite the existence of a <strong>safe and effective vaccine</strong>, the virus continues to spread — especially in regions with limited access to medical infrastructure. But vaccination only protects the uninfected. What about the <strong>254 million people</strong> already living with chronic hepatitis B?</p>
      <p>For them, there is <strong>no cure</strong>. Current treatments can suppress the virus, but they cannot eliminate it. HBV hides inside liver cells in the form of <strong>cccDNA</strong>, which allows the infection to persist for life and evade most available therapies.</p>
      <p>Because of this, hepatitis B has been called a <strong>“forgotten pandemic”</strong> — a global crisis that persists in silence. Without intervention, <strong>1 in 4</strong> chronically infected individuals will eventually die from liver failure or cancer.</p>
      <p>Hepatitis B is not just an infection. It is a problem of access, of awareness, of inequality — and, most of all, of time. <strong>Every 30 seconds</strong>, someone dies from it.</p>
      
      <h3 id="why-solutions">Why Current Solutions Are Not Enough</h3>
      <p>Today’s standard treatments for chronic hepatitis B — like <strong>tenofovir</strong> and <strong>entecavir</strong> — help control the virus but fall far short of a cure. These drugs suppress viral replication and reduce the risk of liver damage, but they do not eliminate the <strong>cccDNA</strong> reservoir that allows the virus to persist inside liver cells.</p>
      <p>As a result, patients require <strong>lifelong therapy</strong>, facing years or decades of daily medication — and the current options come with significant limitations.</p>
      <p>Tenofovir, in particular, has been associated with both renal toxicity and loss of bone mineral density (BMD), especially with long-term use. Although these side effects are widely recognized in older patients or those at elevated clinical risk, recent studies have shown that younger patients with chronic hepatitis B may be more vulnerable to these aftereffects. However, younger patients are often overlooked in risk assessments and treatment decisions, due to the prevailing assumption that they are less vulnerable to such complications and the absence of early screening for subclinical bone or kidney changes in this age group. In a 96-week study of 154 patients on tenofovir monotherapy (median age 36.75), 35.1% developed elevated urinary β2-microglobulin, indicating proximal tubular dysfunction, and 20.1% showed reduced hip BMD. Notably, even among those with normal baseline BMD, sustained tenofovir use led to measurable decreases in bone density and renal function over time.</p>
      <p>Entecavir is generally considered well-tolerated and has a high barrier to resistance. That said, long-term treatment with entecavir still presents notable limitations. Clinical studies have reported rare but serious side effects, including lactic acidosis and mitochondrial toxicity. In addition, while genotypic resistance to entecavir remains relatively uncommon, the risk increases marginally with prolonged therapy, particularly in patients with poor adherence or high baseline viral load. In one 48-week study of 227 patients, virologic breakthrough occurred in 2% of patients by week 96 and 6% by week 144. Among patients with partial virologic response (PVR) and a high viral load at week 48, the cumulative rate of breakthrough rose dramatically to 28.4% by week 144 — nearly five times higher than average — highlighting a vulnerable subgroup. Although genotypic resistance remained rare overall, this study challenges the long-held assumption that resistance under entecavir therapy is negligible. This shows that even without detectable mutations, the virus can resurface — especially if treatment doesn’t fully suppress it or if patients struggle to follow the regimen — highlighting the need for close monitoring and tailored care.</p>
      <p>Moreover, lifelong daily therapy poses a significant burden. While the price of antiviral medications has decreased substantially — with generic tenofovir dropping from $208 in 2004 to just $32 in 2016 — the overall cost of care remains a challenge in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In 2017, nearly all LMICs were legally permitted to procure generic versions of entecavir and tenofovir, yet global treatment coverage remained strikingly low. According to WHO estimates, only about 17% of diagnosed individuals were receiving treatment in 2016, and just 16.7% of the estimated 27 million people aware of their HBV infection were on therapy. Access to these drugs is limited not only by cost, but also by gaps in diagnostic infrastructure, shortages of trained healthcare workers, and insufficient public awareness.</p>
      <p>Ironically, many of the countries with the highest burden of HBV infection — including those in sub-Saharan Africa — are the least equipped to support long-term treatment access. Even in countries with strong economies, like China, access to antiviral therapy for HBV was limited until recent years. Before the inclusion of antivirals into public insurance schemes and substantial price reductions, the cost of treatment posed a serious barrier, particularly in rural and underinsured populations.</p>
      <p>Finally, and most critically, none of these treatments eliminate the cccDNA reservoir in infected liver cells — meaning that the virus can rebound if therapy is paused. There is currently no functional cure for chronic HBV, and patients remain on therapy indefinitely.</p>

      <h3 id="societal-relevance">Societal Relevance</h3>
      <p>China bears the largest burden of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection globally, accounting for approximately <strong>one-third of all chronic HBV cases</strong>. According to a 2024 national epidemiological review, around <strong>75 million people</strong> in China are chronically infected with HBV — a <strong>prevalence of 5.86%</strong>, which is significantly higher than the global average of 3.2%.</p>
      <p>Despite significant progress in reducing new infections through universal neonatal vaccination — with <strong>three-dose coverage at 99.6%</strong> and <strong>timely birth dose coverage at 95.6%</strong> — the <strong>burden of chronic infections remains high</strong>, particularly in older cohorts born before immunization programs were established (Yan et al., 2025). In 2020, HBV led to more than 380,000 liver cancer-related deaths in China, representing <strong>over 30% of global HBV mortality</strong> (WHO Global Hepatitis Report 2024).</p>
      <p>One of the biggest challenges in China’s HBV response is the gap in diagnosis and treatment. As of 2020, <strong>only 58.78%</strong> of HBsAg-positive individuals were aware of their infection, and <strong>just 17.33%</strong> of those eligible were receiving antiviral therapy (Yan et al., 2025). That means <strong>at least 30 million people</strong> remain undiagnosed and <strong>~14 million</strong> are untreated despite medical eligibility. These numbers fall well short of the WHO’s 2030 targets of <strong>90% diagnosis</strong> and <strong>80% treatment coverage</strong>.</p>
      <p>HBV prevalence is <strong>unevenly distributed across regions</strong>, with higher rates found in rural and resource-limited provinces such as Tibet and parts of western China. This regional disparity reflects differences in healthcare access, screening infrastructure, and public awareness.</p>
      <p>A major obstacle in China’s HBV response is the continued virus transmission despite vaccination programs. <strong>Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) </strong> remains critical: transmission rates among HBV-exposed infants still range from <strong>3–5%</strong>, resulting in approximately <strong>50,000 new pediatric infections annually</strong> (Qiao et al., 2019).</p>
      <p>In addition to vertical transmission, <strong>unsafe medical, cosmetic, and body-modification procedures</strong> contribute significantly to HBV spread. Studies have identified <strong>reused or improperly sterilized needles, tattoos, ear piercings, pedicures</strong>, and <strong>cosmetic body care services</strong> —especially in rural areas—as independent risk factors for acute HBV infections (Yan YP et al., 2014). Though vaccination has reduced blood-borne spread substantially, cultural norms and limited oversight in beauty clinics and personal service sectors still pose significant risks.</p>
      <p>Finally, the <strong>socioeconomic and geographic inequalities</strong> in access to diagnosis and treatment services must be addressed to make elimination feasible. While the price of first-line antiviral drugs has dropped significantly through national procurement programs (e.g., tenofovir now costs <10 CNY/month), uptake is still limited by lack of awareness, stigma, and systemic barriers.</p>

      <h3 id="our-solution">Our Solution</h3>
      <p>Persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is maintained by a stable, episomal DNA form known as covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which resides in the nucleus of hepatocytes and resists current therapies. Our project proposes a novel strategy to selectively suppress transcriptional activity from this reservoir using a dual-guide RNA system designed to enhance CRISPR-dCas targeting precision. By reducing off-target effects, this approach aims to enable safer and more effective epigenetic silencing of HBV cccDNA.</p>
      <p>To implement this strategy, we will design and screen RNA sequences that promote stable dimerization of two dCas-bound gRNAs. Several well-characterized RNA dimerization domains are known to form kissing-loop interactions and will serve as a basis for our constructs. We will employ a genetic selection platform based on the Ptet/TetR regulatory system to identify effective RNA-RNA interacting gRNA pairs. This screening system will rely on a reporter circuit where cooperative binding of two dCas complexes induces DNA looping, thereby repressing expression of the TetR repressor. Repression of TetR in turn activates a pTet-controlled reporter gene, allowing us to quantify interaction efficiency.</p>
      <p>As CRISPR targets, we will use DNA fragments from the HBV genome that exhibit the highest rates of cytosine-to-thymine (C-to-T) or guanine-to-adenine (G-to-A) deamination conversion. These regions will be inserted into the modified promoter driving TetR expression, ensuring that only highly cooperative RNA-RNA complexes capable of stable dCas positioning on HBV DNA will trigger reporter activation.</p>
      <p>To enhance screening robustness, we will supplement the library of known kissing-loop variants with randomized sequences at the 3' end of the gRNA, enabling the discovery of novel RNA-RNA interaction motifs. Candidate gRNA pairs selected through the genetic screen will subsequently be validated in vitro using minicircle-derived recombined cccDNA (rcccDNA), which closely mimics native HBV cccDNA in both structure and function. This model provides an accurate and scalable platform to test CRISPR interference or epigenetic silencing effects on persistent HBV templates.</p>
      <p>Together, this system has the potential to increase the specificity of epigenetic editing platforms by over an order of magnitude compared to standard dCas-based designs, offering a powerful new approach for functional suppression of cccDNA without introducing double-stranded breaks.</p>
      
      <h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
      <p>In our project, we aim to develop a strategy for suppressing the expression of HBV genes transcribed from covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) — the persistent viral reservoir — in order to block the production and replication of viral particles using CRISPR-based tools.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify the key HBV genomic regions and genes responsible for viral replication and sustained cccDNA activity.</li>
        <li>Engineer a dual-guide RNA system capable of forming cooperative dCas protein complexes via designed RNA–RNA interactions.</li>
        <li>Develop a selection platform using genetic circuits to screen for the most stable and specific RNA–RNA dimerization pairs.</li>
        <li>Characterize and validate the selected guide RNA pairs in vitro for their ability to form stable complexes and bind cccDNA targets effectively.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 id="hypothesis">Hypothesis</h3>
      <p>The transcriptional activity of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is a major factor in the persistence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Several approaches have been explored to silence this reservoir, including direct DNA cleavage, epigenetic editing, and transcriptional repression.</p>
      <p>We hypothesize that combining CRISPR-dCas-based epigenetic silencing with optimized dual-guide RNA architecture can achieve highly specific and durable suppression of HBV gene expression. In the future, such systems may also synergize with antiviral drugs (e.g. Sofosbuvir and Velpatasvir) to enhance therapeutic efficacy against chronic HBV infection.</p>
      
      <h3 id="scientific-background">Scientific Background</h3>
      <p>The life cycle of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is complex and includes multiple stages, each playing a critical role in viral persistence. After entering hepatocytes, the partially double-stranded virion DNA is transported into the nucleus, where it is converted into covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). This episomal DNA serves as a stable epigenetic template for the transcription of all viral RNAs required to produce new viral particles.</p>
      <p>cccDNA is extraordinarily stable: it can persist in the nucleus for years and is not eliminated by current therapeutic approaches. This is the main reason why HBV remains a chronic and difficult-to-cure infection. One of the viral proteins involved in regulating cccDNA activity is HBx — a transcriptional activator that interacts with host chromatin and epigenetic machinery to modulate gene expression.</p>
      <p>Recent studies have shown that HBV exploits host chromatin remodeling factors and may interact with nucleosomal sites via both viral and host proteins. For example, interactions with the nucleosomal supergroove — demonstrated for Haspin kinase — suggest possible analogous mechanisms for viral factors. Histone modifications such as acetylation and methylation also play a role in determining the accessibility of cccDNA for transcription.</p>
      <p>Despite this growing understanding of the molecular underpinnings of cccDNA persistence, efforts to eliminate it using traditional antiviral therapies remain unsuccessful. In this context, novel bioengineering strategies capable of long-term suppression or silencing of cccDNA transcriptional activity are gaining attention.</p>
      <p>The transition from cccDNA to rcDNA (relaxed circular DNA) is a key step in the HBV life cycle. Elimination of cccDNA is particularly challenging because of its stability and persistence in the nucleus, where it acts as a long-term reservoir for viral RNA transcription. Although several strategies for its elimination have been proposed, none are fully effective with current therapeutic methods.</p>
      <p>Complete eradication of cccDNA remains the ultimate goal in treating chronic hepatitis B. Current therapies — including interferons and nucleos(t)ide analogues — suppress viral replication but do not destroy cccDNA. Promising approaches involve using CRISPR/Cas technologies to silence or degrade cccDNA.</p>
      <p>One of the most promising directions involves using dCas proteins — catalytically inactive versions of Cas — to regulate gene expression without introducing DNA breaks. These systems can modulate the epigenetic landscape around cccDNA loci and have been shown to induce long-lasting changes in gene expression.</p>
      <p>However, even dCas-based systems can retain off-target activity. To address this, various strategies have been developed, including engineered Cas variants, modified guide RNAs, and dual-guide RNA systems. These approaches have been reported to improve editing precision by up to 1500-fold. Additionally, fusing dCas proteins with methyltransferase domains enhances specificity and efficacy of epigenetic modulation.</p>
      <p>Thus, in the context of chronic HBV infection, the development of highly specific CRISPR-based epigenetic platforms targeting cccDNA — without compromising host genome integrity — emerges as a key strategy in overcoming viral persistence and achieving long-term suppression.</p>
